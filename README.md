This is a simple terminal application for a school, which I started to develop during a Java Workshop on November 2025. 

As it was the first time I was programming with Java, the goal was to get myself familiar with the syntax and semantik of Java. 
I also applied some object orientated principles. I made different classes (in this case the classes 'Teacher' and 'Student') and instanciated several objects of these classes.
Furthermore I implemented encapsulation and polymorphism.
